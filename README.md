# doctor-contact-api

**Hi everyone.**

This is a basic Rest API with authentication, some security checks, database-use ready, tests and code coverage, so you can make some frontend/mobile app tests on it and to learn how to make a Rest API.

### Setup
* Add another `.env` file with the expected values.
* Run `npm install` and make sure your node version is `18.17.1`.
* (Optional) If you need to create the tables, just uncomment `// alter: true` from the server.js file.
* You should be good to go. Have fun!

If you want me to add something else feel free to let me know.
